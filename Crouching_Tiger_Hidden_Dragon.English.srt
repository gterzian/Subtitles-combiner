1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,600
Master Li is here!

2
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,400
Master Li is here!

3
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,400
Shu Lien!

4
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,000
Li Mu Bai is here!

5
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,100
How's everything? Fine. Please come in.

6
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,700
Mu Bai, it's been too long.

7
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,900
It has.

8
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,500
How's business? Good.

9
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,400
And how are you? Fine.

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.

11
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,000
He said you were practicing deep meditation.

12
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,200
The mountain must be so peaceful...

13
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,400
I envy you.

14
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,200
My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.

15
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,500
I left the training early.

16
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,200
Why? You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.

17
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,800
During my meditation training...

18
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,700
I came to a place of deep silence...

19
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,900
I was surrounded by light...

20
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,000
Time and space disappeared.

21
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,600
I had come to a place my master had never told me about.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,500
You were enlightened?

23
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,100
No.

24
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,600
I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.

25
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,200
Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.

26
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,900
I couldn't bear it.

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,300
I broke off my meditation.

28
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,200
I couldn't go on.

29
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,500
There was something... pulling me back.

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,900
What was it?

31
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,400
Something I can't let go of.

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,500
You're leaving soon?

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,700
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
to Peking.

35
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,700
Perhaps I could ask you

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,400
to deliver something to Sir Te for me.

37
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,600
The Green Destiny sword? You're giving it to Sir Te?

38
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,000
I am. He has always been our greatest protector.

39
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't understand. How can you part with it?

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,600
It has always been with you.

41
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,900
Too many men have died at its edge.

42
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,800
It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.

43
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,400
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.

44
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,600
It's time for me to leave it behind.

45
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,600
So what will you do now?

46
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,300
Come with me to Peking.

47
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,400
You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself.

48
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,100
It'll be just like old times.

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,300
First I must visit my master's grave.

50
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,600
It's been many years since...

51
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,200
Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet to avenge his death.

52
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,300
And yet I'm thinking of quitting.

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,200
I must pray for his forgiveness.

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,700
Join me once you have finished.

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,100
I can wait for you in Peking.

56
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,600
Perhaps.

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,600
Ok. Pass.

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,200
Thanks.

59
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,200
Let's go into the city.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,700
Everything got here safely. I'm much obliged.

61
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,800
Just doing my job.

62
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,100
Sun Security has been the best since your father started it.

63
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,400
You're a credit to his memory.

64
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Thank you.

65
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
I mean it.

66
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,700
This is Li Mu Bai's personal sword,

67
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
a great hero's weapon.

68
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:02,600
He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.

69
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,600
It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.

70
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,800
Sir Te...

71
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,200
it has brought him as much trouble as glory.

72
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,000
Help him to leave these troubles behind.

73
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,900
Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.

74
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,000
All right.

75
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,900
I'll act as the sword's custodian.

76
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,700
Governor Yu has arrived.

77
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,000
I must change.

78
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,600
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.

79
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Please accept our thanks.

80
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,200
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest.

81
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,900
Now, Shu Lien...

82
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,000
tell me something.

83
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,700
And forgive me for prying.

84
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,500
Your father was a great friend to me,

85
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,700
and I think of you as my own daughter.

86
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,900
Please, Sir Te, what is it?

87
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,400
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword

88
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,700
and his warrior days...

89
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Maybe he's trying to tell you something?

90
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,500
I don't know...

91
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,000
Don't be coy. I've always known about your feelings for each other.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,200
All these years, it's a shame...

93
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,400
...neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other.

94
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,800
You're both wasting precious time.

95
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,300
I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.

96
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,600
When it comes to emotions,

97
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,800
even great heroes can be idiots.

98
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:36,300
Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.

99
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,200
I'll give him an earful!

100
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,400
Sir Te said to leave the sword in here.

101
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,300
Who are you?

102
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm your guest today.

103
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,400
I am Governor Yu's daughter.

104
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,800
This is Sir Te's study. You are here to?

105
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,800
I was just looking for a quiet corner.

106
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,900
I am Sir Te's head servant.

107
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,800
And this is another of our guests.

108
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,600
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!

109
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,300
The handle is heavy. And the blade is no ordinary metal.

110
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,300
Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons.

111
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,700
You're just not used to handling it.

112
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,400
But, I have had much practice.

113
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,400
As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.

114
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
They'd let me play with their weapons.

115
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,100
The scabbard is so beautiful.

116
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
Beautiful but dangerous.

117
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,400
Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,800
It's 400 years old.

119
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,600
Exquisite!

120
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,300
You said it belongs to...

121
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,400
My friend Li Mu Bai. He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.

122
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,600
Li Mu Bai!

123
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,000
The famous warrior?

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,100
Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?

125
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,500
You're too young to understand.

126
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,100
You're a sword fighter too?

127
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,100
Yes, I am.

128
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,100
But I prefer the machete.

129
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,500
Certain moves, however, call for a sword.

130
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,800
Really?

131
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,100
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!

132
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,000
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust,

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,700
integrity... Without rules,

134
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,200
we wouldn't survive for long.

135
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,800
I've read all about people like you.

136
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,700
Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!

137
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,600
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.

138
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,200
But you're just like the characters in the stories.

139
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,600
Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds...

140
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,700
They tell you all about that in those books?

141
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
You know what I mean.

142
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,100
I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.

143
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,000
So I heard. Congratulations.

144
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,300
It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?

145
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,200
You're not married, are you?

146
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
What do you think?

147
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,000
No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were.

148
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,600
You're probably right.

149
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,900
Go ahead, Governor Yu.

150
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,100
2 feet 9 inches long.

151
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,200
1 inch wide.

152
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,800
The handle is 1 inch deep, 2.6 inches wide.

153
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,400
7 tenths of an inch thick.

154
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
With seven rubies missing from the hilt.

155
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
You can tell the design

156
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,200
dates back to before the Chin era.

157
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,300
Engraved with a technique lost by the time of the Han Dynasty.

158
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,900
Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

159
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,000
A sword by itself rules nothing.

160
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,400
It comes alive only through skillful manipulation.

161
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,700
I see your point. Please continue.

162
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,800
The Imperial Court isn't the problem.

163
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,600
With royalty and officials everywhere,

164
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,400
the Royal Guard keeps security tight.

165
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,300
But Peking is not like the West.

166
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,800
Here, you'll find all sorts of characters.

167
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Proceed with caution in your quest for law and order.

168
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,000
Don't depend only on the court.

169
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,700
Contacts in the Giang Hu underworld

170
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,500
can ensure your position.

171
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,500
Be strong yet supple.

172
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
This is the way to rule.

173
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,900
Governess...

174
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,700
Let me do it.

175
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,500
Please sit.

176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,800
I've made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them?

177
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,200
Put them down.

178
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,700
I heard you met Shu Lien today.

179
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,900
Do you know her?

180
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,300
She's one of those.

181
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,900
Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.

182
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,000
I'll socialize with whomever I please.

183
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,200
Don't invite danger into your father's house.

184
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,900
I'm tired now!

185
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,400
Go to bed then.

186
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,400
Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.

187
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,500
God knows what the future will bring.

188
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,200
It'll be just the same.

189
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,500
Enough! I'm tired.

190
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,700
Autumn is coming.

191
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,000
I'll shut the windows for you.

192
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,700
Chilly, eh? Yes, Master Bo.

193
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,800
Someone help!

194
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,500
Stop him!

195
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,000
He's on the roof!

196
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,900
The sword's been stolen!

197
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,300
Stop thief!

198
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,900
Stop him!

199
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
It's Jade Fox!

200
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
We must avenge Mother!

201
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,000
Do something! He's getting away!

202
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,000
Return the sword and I'll let you go.

203
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
You've been trained at Wudan?

204
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,200
You're mistaken.

205
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,100
We're just street performers. We were rehearsing.

206
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,900
Father!

207
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,900
You were rehearsing?

208
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,800
Who are you trying to fool?

209
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,600
Where did that thief go?

210
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,200
Governor Yu's house!

211
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,400
Get down here!

212
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,300
Give back the sword!

213
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,700
Sir Te awaits you.

214
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,300
I'm sure the thief is in the Yu household.

215
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,500
How dare you imply?

216
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Enough!

217
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,400
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

218
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,700
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.

219
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,700
But the sword could be in his compound.

220
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,700
Then someone's trying to set him up.

221
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,900
We should inform Li Mu Bai.

222
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,600
What is it?

223
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,700
Madam Yu, someone's put up posters.

224
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,500
Let me see.

225
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Someone is after a Jade Fox.

226
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,100
Preposterous, looking for her here!

227
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,500
Where are they? I don't know.

228
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,600
I haven't seen them in two days.

229
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,900
There's a Miss Shu Lien here to see you.

230
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,400
Miss is busy right now.

231
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,700
I'll tell her.

232
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,600
Show her in.

233
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,400
This spells trouble.

234
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,300
I have a guest.

235
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,500
This way please.

236
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,400
I've missed you.

237
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,400
How so?

238
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,100
I'm bored...

239
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,200
You're doing calligraphy?

240
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
I'll write your name.

241
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,100
Just for fun.

242
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,900
I never realized my name looks like "sword".

243
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,800
You write gracefully. Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.

244
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,000
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.

245
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,600
Please.

246
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,100
Thank you for seeing me. I hear your wedding day is near.

247
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,300
You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.

248
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,200
I'm hardly doing a thing. The less I think of it the better.

249
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,100
My parents are arranging everything.

250
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,200
The Gous are a very powerful family.

251
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,400
My marrying one will be good for my father's career.

252
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,100
You are fortunate to marry into such a noble family.

253
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Am I?

254
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,800
I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.

255
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,300
Like you and Li Mu Bai.

256
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,900
I guess I'm happy to be marrying.

257
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But to be free to live my own life,

258
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,200
to choose whom I love...

259
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,700
That is true happiness.

260
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,400
Do you think so? Let me tell you a story...

261
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,000
About you and Li Mu Bai?

262
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,300
Yes.

263
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,600
Did you know I was once engaged to be married?

264
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
No, really?

265
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,000
His name was Meng Si Zhao.

266
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,100
He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.

267
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,400
One day, while in battle,

268
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,500
he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.

269
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,000
After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.

270
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,200
Our feelings for each other grew stronger.

271
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,700
But how could we dishonor

272
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
Meng's memory?

273
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,300
So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.

274
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,600
But I have never tasted it.

275
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:55,300
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

276
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,600
I am not an aristocrat, as you are...

277
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,200
but I must still respect a woman's duties.

278
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,200
Don't distance us.

279
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,500
From now on, let's be like sisters.

280
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,300
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.

281
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,600
What a godforsaken place!

282
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,500
Can't your father be appointed closer to civilization?

283
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,200
Jen...

284
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,500
are you listening to me?

285
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,000
Let's go.

286
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,000
Who are you?

287
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,200
Wait! I'm a friend!

288
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,300
I don't care about your sword.

289
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,500
Why were you spying on the Yus?

290
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,400
I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox.

291
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,900
I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.

292
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,200
Jade Fox is a master criminal. I hear she infiltrated the Yus.

293
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,300
She must have come with them when they transferred here.

294
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,800
But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.

295
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,700
This Jade Fox is a woman? Yes.

296
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Then leave her to me.

297
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,400
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.

298
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,000
My wife was quite a martial arts expert.

299
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,400
Jade Fox killed her.

300
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
So you see,

301
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,700
this is personal. Leave her to me.

302
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,600
It's ready.

303
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,200
I'm ready for anything!

304
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,700
Father gets first dip.

305
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,100
They're gone!

306
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,200
What does it say?

307
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,600
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."

308
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,400
Good! The fox is out of her hole!

309
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,500
Shu Lien, look who's here.

310
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,400
Sir Te believes it's a ploy to cast suspicion on Governor Yu.

311
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,600
But something is going on at the Yu household.

312
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,400
What have you discovered?

313
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,500
Jade Fox?

314
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,900
Impossible!

315
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,700
You'd always suspected she'd fled to the West.

316
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,200
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!

317
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,200
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?

318
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,400
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.

319
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,800
Be careful.

320
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,500
Sir Te requires discretion.

321
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,700
Official business is difficult enough.

322
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,300
Don't let personal feelings make it worse.

323
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,600
And I don't know... even this poster...

324
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,600
could be some sort of trap.

325
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,500
Did you see who posted it?

326
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,700
No.

327
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,000
It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.

328
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,200
On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.

329
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,900
Were you involved?

330
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.

331
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,800
I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.

332
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,500
Have you questioned him yet?

333
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
No, not yet...

334
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,200
But your men are watching over Yu's compound?

335
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,100
No, I'd already sent them home.

336
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,600
You can blame me for losing the sword,

337
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,900
but please trust that I'll get it back soon

338
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,900
using my own methods.

339
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,700
That's not what I meant.

340
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,400
I don't care about the sword.

341
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,500
What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it?

342
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,200
I didn't know it was stolen until I got here.

343
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,300
Then, why did you come?

344
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,100
Well, we had talked...

345
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,000
Pardon my intrusion. Master Li,

346
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,800
your room is ready.

347
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,700
Thank you.

348
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Please, lead the way.

349
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,600
The Fox doesn't care much for punctuality.

350
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,800
Still no sign of her.

351
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,900
Enough! Show yourself!

352
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300
Tsai...

353
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,000
You dog!

354
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,900
You will pay for your stubbornness!

355
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,900
That's what you think, old witch!

356
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,100
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.

357
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,500
But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.

358
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,100
Father!

359
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,400
Let me avenge my mother's death!

360
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,700
You'll soon end up like her, you little whore!

361
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,100
You'll pay for that!

362
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,500
She's going to paralyze you!

363
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,100
May!

364
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,500
Tsai, you filthy mongrel!

365
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,800
An ambush!

366
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,500
Father, are you all right?

367
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,300
Wudan should have gotten rid of you long ago.

368
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
It's been a long time, Jade Fox!

369
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,700
You don't remember me...

370
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,800
But you should remember my master.

371
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,900
You infiltrated Wudan while I was away.

372
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,300
You stole our secret manual

373
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,500
and poisoned our master!

374
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,400
Now it's time for you to pay!

375
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,500
Your master underestimated us women.

376
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he would never teach me.

377
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,400
He deserved to die by a woman's hand!

378
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,500
You stole the secrets of Wudan's highest martial arts.

379
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,500
But after ten years of training your moves are still undisciplined.

380
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,000
And today,

381
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,800
under a Wudan sword...

382
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,500
you will die!

383
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,000
Disciple, we'll kill them all!

384
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
Let's go!

385
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,800
Another one!

386
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,200
I must get rid of Tsai!

387
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,200
Who are you?

388
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?

389
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
What's it to you?

390
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,100
My name is Li Mu Bai.

391
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,600
The Green Destiny is mine.

392
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,900
Jade Fox can't be your master.

393
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,900
Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?

394
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,800
I'm just playing around.

395
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,100
Tell me, who is your master?

396
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,500
Let's go! We must kill them!

397
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,400
Father!

398
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,900
This is Tsai?

399
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,700
My father.

400
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,300
Police inspector from Shaan.

401
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,000
This should be reported to Governor Yu.

402
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,100
The victim is an officer.

403
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,700
You believe the killer is hiding out in his compound?

404
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,400
I'd bet my life on it!

405
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,300
Come with me.

406
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,600
This needs to be resolved, and quickly.

407
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,900
I'll get into the Yu household and get her.

408
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,700
I'll ferret out Fox and her gang.

409
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,000
We must be careful.

410
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,500
Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.

411
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,600
Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.

412
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,400
It might get Sir Te in trouble.

413
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,600
This is a delicate matter.

414
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,800
Sir Te, can you find some excuse

415
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,800
to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?

416
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,900
What do you have in mind?

417
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,500
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.

418
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,200
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.

419
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,900
She's being so considerate.

420
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,800
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.

421
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,700
I heard Sir Te lost something.

422
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,900
And now Madam Te's not feeling well...

423
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,300
We know who stole the missing item.

424
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:52,200
If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue

425
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,100
the matter no further.

426
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,500
That's good.

427
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,600
Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves.

428
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,300
It's very embarrassing.

429
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,300
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes...

430
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,500
that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.

431
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,600
But don't be too lenient.

432
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,800
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer

433
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,300
who turned up in Peking.

434
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
A murderer?

435
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,100
Yes,

436
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,400
the very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.

437
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,200
Last night,

438
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,000
she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.

439
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,900
A female criminal! Now that's news!

440
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You say she killed a policeman?

441
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,700
Yes, from the West.

442
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,400
He went undercover, and followed her here.

443
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,100
Maybe the murderer

444
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,900
and the thief are the same.

445
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,900
I doubt that.

446
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,500
This thief...

447
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,000
is very unusual.

448
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,300
And most likely smarter than a mere killer.

449
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,000
Greetings, Sir Te.

450
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,700
Hello, Madam Yu.

451
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,900
This is Li Mu Bai,

452
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,500
the renowned swordsman.

453
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,100
Delighted to meet you.

454
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,900
Miss Yu is soon to be married.

455
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,400
Congratulations.

456
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,600
Why don't you come in?

457
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,300
I'm standing guard.

458
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,000
Come in. It's cold.

459
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,600
Come in.

460
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,800
We don't have to fear Jade Fox if we're together.

461
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,500
Isn't it a bit late to be out?

462
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,300
You've brought me the sword?

463
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,400
I do as I please.

464
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,500
Where is your master?

465
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,900
What's it to you?

466
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,100
Had enough flying?

467
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,700
You've got potential.

468
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,100
You've studied the Wudan manual but you don't understand it.

469
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,300
You need a real master.

470
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,800
Do you think you are a real master?

471
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,600
Like most things, I am nothing.

472
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,500
It's the same for this sword.

473
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,000
All of it is simply a state of mind.

474
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,800
Stop talking like a monk!

475
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Just fight!

476
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,600
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

477
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,400
On guard!

478
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,300
Real sharpness comes without effort.

479
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,900
No growth.

480
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,200
Without assistance.

481
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,000
No action.

482
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,600
Without reaction.

483
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,700
No desire without restraint.

484
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,400
Now give yourself up and find yourself again.

485
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,000
There is a lesson for you.

486
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,000
Go ahead.

487
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,800
Why should I?

488
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,000
You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny,

489
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.

490
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,000
Why do you want to teach me?

491
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,500
I've always wanted a disciple

492
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,000
worthy of Wudan's secrets.

493
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,600
And if I use them to kill you?

494
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,200
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

495
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,300
Deep down, you're good. Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.

496
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,100
Wudan is a whorehouse!

497
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,300
Keep your lessons!

498
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,900
You're home late...

499
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,400
or should I say early?

500
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,400
Why are you still here? You killed a policeman.

501
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,100
You should leave!

502
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,700
You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

503
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,100
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.

504
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,900
Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?

505
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,500
You, too, are responsible for that death. Come with me.

506
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,500
You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.

507
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,300
Denied your talent...

508
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,900
As master and disciple we will rule.

509
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,100
I'll never live as a thief!

510
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,000
You're already a thief.

511
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,300
That was just for fun.

512
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
How can I leave? Where would I go?

513
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,000
Wherever we want.

514
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,800
We'll get rid of anyone in our way.

515
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,900
Even your father.

516
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,100
Shut up!

517
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,200
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed.

518
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,900
Exciting, isn't it?

519
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,300
I owe you nothing.

520
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,500
Yes, you do!

521
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,900
You are still my disciple.

522
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,000
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual?

523
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,900
You couldn't even decipher the symbols!

524
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,400
I studied the diagrams.

525
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,300
But you hid the details!

526
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,000
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.

527
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,600
You know...

528
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,900
you've gone as far as you can go.

529
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,200
I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.

530
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,500
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai,

531
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,100
I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.

532
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,300
Master...

533
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,900
I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.

534
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,100
You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.

535
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,400
But once I realized I could surpass you,

536
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,100
I became so frightened!

537
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,500
Everything fell apart.

538
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,700
I had no one to guide me,

539
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,900
no one to learn from.

540
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,700
Believe me,

541
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,800
I've a lesson or two left to teach you!

542
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,800
The sword is back...

543
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,000
Are you happy?

544
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,000
I admit...

545
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,700
getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.

546
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,600
But it's not your sword anymore.

547
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,900
You gave it to Sir Te.

548
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,400
True.

549
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,500
But I must borrow it for one last mission.

550
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,500
Jade Fox must die at its edge.

551
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,600
Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?

552
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,100
My job was to get the sword back, without embarrassing anyone.

553
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,900
I wasn't about to ruin

554
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,300
her life, or her father's.

555
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,100
You did your job well.

556
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,800
But, this girl...

557
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,000
I saw her last night.

558
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,400
I knew she would intrigue you.

559
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,800
She needs direction...

560
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,000
and training.

561
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,100
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.

562
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,200
In any case, it will all be over soon.

563
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,000
You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.

564
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,400
That's not for her.

565
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,800
She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.

566
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,500
But Wudan does not accept women.

567
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,700
For her, they might make an exception.

568
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,600
If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.

569
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,800
It's not our affair.

570
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,700
Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.

571
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,500
I thought by giving away the sword,

572
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,500
I could escape the Giang Hu world.

573
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,300
But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

574
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,500
I wish there were something more

575
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,800
I could do to help you.

576
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,100
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

577
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,900
Lo?

578
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,500
Jen!

579
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,700
You shouldn't have come.

580
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,300
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days...

581
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,100
it took me a while to get in here.

582
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,100
I can't wait any longer.

583
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,800
I was wrong to let you go.

584
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,400
Come back with me.

585
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,000
You'll be happy in the desert.

586
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,900
You'll be free there.

587
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,900
You've been looking for me all this time?

588
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,000
Jen...

589
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,800
Stop playing with it.

590
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,300
I won't break it.

591
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,400
It's Dark Cloud!

592
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,900
Dark Cloud is coming!

593
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,200
Lower the shade, don't let them see you!

594
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,700
Don't touch the women!

595
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,500
Let's go!

596
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,500
Come get your comb.

597
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,700
Hurry back to your mother.

598
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,000
She's mine!

599
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,200
Leave her to me!

600
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,700
Come and get it!

601
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,600
Give me back my comb!

602
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,500
Let's stop a moment.

603
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,200
Give it back!

604
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,900
You're tired. You need rest.

605
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,700
Your horse needs water. There's a creek up here.

606
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,100
Well, there used to be!

607
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,200
What's your name?

608
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,300
I'm Lo.

609
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,600
The Hans call me Dark Cloud.

610
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,500
I'm not that tall or big,

611
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,400
but I'm quick as lightning.

612
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,000
My comb!

613
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,900
If you like that arrow, I can make you a bow.

614
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,300
Great for hunting wild chicken.

615
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,100
They're delicious.

616
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,700
You need to eat. Understand?

617
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,700
Then you'll have the strength to fight.

618
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,400
Understand?

619
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,900
You're eating too fast.

620
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,400
Slowly.

621
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,400
You've got quite a temper.

622
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,400
It's better this way...

623
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,100
You coward!

624
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,800
Still in a bad mood?

625
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,000
At least you're speaking.

626
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,600
What's your name?

627
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,700
I didn't think the Hans had names like that.

628
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,600
Relax.

629
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,200
If I had wanted to, I would already have done it.

630
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,500
You must be dying for a bath.

631
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,700
Fresh water's hard to get here.

632
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,500
But I managed to bring some up.

633
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,100
You can wear my clothes when you're done.

634
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,200
They're clean.

635
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,600
Don't worry.

636
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:00,000
I'll sing, so you'll know where I am.

637
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,100
After the bath, you'll be calmer.

638
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,700
No more hitting on the head!

639
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,900
All this trouble for a comb?

640
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,200
It's mine.

641
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,300
It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.

642
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,500
Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.

643
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,900
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

644
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,000
I'm sorry...

645
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,700
I guessed wrong.

646
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,500
I thought you were a Han.

647
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,600
Give me back my comb.

648
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,600
I don't take orders from anyone.

649
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,100
Give it back.

650
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,000
One night...

651
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,700
when I was a boy, I saw a thousand shooting stars.

652
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,500
I thought, "Where did they all go?"

653
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,800
I'm an orphan. I used to look for stars alone.

654
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:33,800
I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.

655
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,400
I've been riding in the desert ever since.

656
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,200
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.

657
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,400
He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.

658
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,300
Out here, you always fight for survival.

659
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:52,900
You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.

660
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,200
Slowly, your gang becomes your family.

661
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:00,100
All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people

662
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,400
and make my life easier.

663
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,700
So you are still that little boy

664
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,000
looking for shooting stars.

665
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,900
I am a man.

666
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,500
And now I've found the brightest star of all.

667
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,600
Your father's men are looking for you.

668
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,200
They're still out there, circling closer.

669
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,400
Let them look.

670
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,900
It is trouble for me.

671
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,100
Don't send me back.

672
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,500
You must decide.

673
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,500
You might get tired of this life.

674
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:34,100
You might begin to miss your family.

675
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,800
If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.

676
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,100
She would miss us.

677
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:45,900
Jen...

678
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,400
I want you to be mine forever.

679
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,900
I will make my mark on the world.

680
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,500
I will earn your parents respect.

681
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,100
We have a legend.

682
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,600
Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain,

683
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,800
God will grant his wish.

684
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:07,000
Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.

685
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,500
He didn't die.

686
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,700
He wasn't even hurt.

687
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,700
He floated away, far away, never to return.

688
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,100
He knew his wish had come true.

689
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,200
If you believe, it will happen.

690
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,900
The elders say,

691
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,900
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true".

692
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,200
Keep it safe.

693
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,100
Return it to me when we are together again.

694
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,400
I will.

695
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,200
If you don't, I'll come after you.

696
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,600
And I won't let you off so easy.

697
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:15,300
Wherever I went someone always recognized me.

698
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,800
I really tried.

699
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,600
Later, I heard you came to Peking.

700
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,100
I was afraid I'd never see you again.

701
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,200
So I came.

702
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,700
I can't let you marry.

703
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,800
Go.

704
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,800
Jen...

705
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,500
Don't ever come back.

706
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,100
So it's over?

707
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,600
Yes.

708
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,900
We heard noises.

709
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,600
It was just a cat.

710
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,800
You think Jade Fox will show up?

711
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,900
She's out there,

712
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,100
but I doubt she'll show herself.

713
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,700
We'll keep our eyes open.

714
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:31,700
Sooner or later,

715
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
she'll come for the girl.

716
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,700
Jen!

717
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,200
Come with me!

718
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,500
You're mine! Come with me to the desert!

719
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:34,900
Jen!

720
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,400
Come with me to Xin Jiang!

721
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,300
Tell me.

722
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,700
Where is Jade Fox?

723
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,500
Come with me. Hurry!

724
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:52,800
You thought she'd give it all up and go back West with you?

725
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,400
She's mine.

726
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,700
Either way,

727
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,400
you are no good to her dead. With the Gou and Yu clans

728
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,300
hunting you, you'll soon be in their hands.

729
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,900
I don't care anymore.

730
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,000
If you truly loved her, you wouldn't say that.

731
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,900
Don't you want to see her again?

732
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,100
All right.

733
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,600
I'll write you an introduction. Take it to Wudan.

734
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,600
Wait there for news from me.

735
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
All right.

736
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,900
When will this end?

737
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,700
They take it, they put it back, they take it again.

738
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,800
My home is turning into a warehouse.

739
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,700
Come in.

740
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,700
Speak!

741
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,200
Jen has run away!

742
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,600
Gou found the wedding chamber empty.

743
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:55,400
Governor Yu requests your assistance.

744
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,100
You know the Giang Hu underworld.

745
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,900
He wants to find her, and keep her from harm.

746
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,700
Sir Te, leave this to us. Don't worry.

747
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,700
What can I serve you?

748
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,100
This cup is dirty.

749
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:43,600
Hello.

750
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,600
What's your name?

751
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,600
Long.

752
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,100
It's young Master Long.

753
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,400
My apologies!

754
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,400
I'm Iron Eagle Sung

755
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,900
and this is my brother in arms,

756
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,800
Flying Cougar Li Yun.

757
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,300
What brings you to Huai An,

758
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,700
and where are you headed, Master Long?

759
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,200
Anywhere there's action.

760
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,800
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.

761
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,500
Don't bother.

762
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,600
You don't seem to understand.

763
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,900
So what if I don't?

764
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,800
We have ways of helping you to understand.

765
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,800
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

766
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,800
He is my defeated foe!

767
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,600
Have some tea.

768
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,700
Shu Lien...

769
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,200
The things we touch have no permanence.

770
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:38,000
My master would say...

771
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,500
there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.

772
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:46,500
Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.

773
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:50,900
Not everything is an illusion.

774
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,700
My hand...

775
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,000
wasn't that real?

776
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:01,300
Your hand, rough and callused from practice...

777
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:04,400
All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.

778
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:12,400
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons,

779
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,600
full of corruption...

780
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,300
I tried sincerely to give it up

781
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,600
but I have brought us only trouble.

782
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,300
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.

783
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,600
You're right, but I don't know what to do.

784
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,900
I want to be with you...

785
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,800
just like this.

786
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,300
It gives me a sense of peace.

787
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,500
Please follow me.

788
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:02,700
I want a clean room. We have plenty.

789
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,300
Your order?

790
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,900
Steamed whole cod, bite-size meatballs,

791
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,500
a little starchy, but keep the sauce light,

792
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,700
shark fin soup, mixed vegetables, and some warm wine.

793
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,900
I have to order from a bigger restaurant.

794
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,000
Hurry then.

795
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,600
That's him.

796
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,300
I am Iron Arm Mi.

797
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:16,600
I heard a true master has arrived. I have come to seek a lesson.

798
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,700
You asked for it!

799
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,000
What kind of Iron Arm are you?

800
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,400
You have amazing technique!

801
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,800
I am Flying Saber.

802
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,800
Are you related to Southern Crane?

803
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:17,000
Southern Duck? I don't eat anything with two feet.

804
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,200
Who could remember such long-winded names?

805
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,600
Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe,

806
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:25,400
and you don't know his master Southern Crane?

807
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,600
Who are you?

808
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,600
I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.

809
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,200
Gou?

810
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:37,400
I hate that name.

811
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,100
It makes me puke!

812
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,200
Too bad you're named Gou.

813
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,500
You'll be the first to feel my sword today.

814
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,200
Hold it!

815
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,700
Don't you know Monk Jing?

816
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,400
A monk, in a place like this? You need a lesson!

817
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,100
Who are you?

818
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,400
Who am I?

819
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:17,700
I am...

820
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,200
I am the Invincible Sword Goddess.

821
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,600
Armed with the incredible...

822
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,200
Green Destiny.

823
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,400
Be you Li or Southern Crane...

824
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,400
lower your head...

825
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,700
and ask for mercy.

826
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,000
I am the desert dragon.

827
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:03,100
I leave no trace.

828
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:16,400
Today I fly over Eu-Mei.

829
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,500
Tomorrow...

830
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:23,100
I'll kick over Wudan Mountain!

831
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,600
We politely asked for a friendly match,

832
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,900
but she showed no respect, and attacked us.

833
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,600
Everyone came by to teach her a lesson.

834
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,800
Her sword was just too powerful.

835
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,100
I've traveled everywhere,

836
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,200
but never met anyone so uncivilized.

837
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:55,600
She kept accusing me of being Gou Jun Pei's brother.

838
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,500
Who is this Gou, anyway?

839
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,100
Her husband.

840
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,100
We're close to your headquarters.

841
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,600
Go home and check in.

842
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,000
What about you?

843
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,400
I'll look around and catch up later.

844
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,300
Not a bad idea.

845
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:25,400
Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.

846
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,800
Mistress, you're back.

847
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,700
It's you!

848
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,200
How is everything here?

849
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:02,100
Fine.

850
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,900
You've been gone a while.

851
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,500
Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.

852
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,600
Your wife was due? Yeah, a baby girl.

853
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,400
Good!

854
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,300
I'll be happy if she's half as strong as you.

855
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:12,900
Mrs. Wu...

856
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,900
You're back!

857
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,300
How's the arm? Still sore? Much better.

858
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:21,100
You've been gone so long.

859
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:24,300
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.

860
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,200
I'll go and make up his room!

861
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,400
Sister Shu Lien...

862
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,500
Here you must be in proper attire.

863
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:11,100
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes. I'm not staying.

864
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,300
I'll give them to you.

865
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,500
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.

866
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:22,400
You, sister...

867
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,300
Look at the trouble you've caused.

868
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,200
Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.

869
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,900
If you think of me as your sister,

870
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,500
let me give you some sisterly advice.

871
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,700
You can run from marriage, but not your parents.

872
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,100
They forced me to marry!

873
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:47,100
Go back to them first.

874
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,200
Then you can decide about Lo.

875
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
You know about Lo?

876
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,700
He really loves you.

877
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:07,300
Come back to Peking with me. We'll find a solution.

878
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,400
Where is he now?

879
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,500
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.

880
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:20,100
He sent him to Wudan Mountain.

881
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,700
You're working together to set me up! I'm leaving!

882
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:26,300
How dare you accuse us!

883
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,600
I always knew you had stolen the sword!

884
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:31,200
I've done nothing but protect you and your family.

885
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,500
And you've repaid me with nothing but contempt.

886
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,600
Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.

887
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:39,800
We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all!

888
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,700
You're no sister of mine!

889
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,300
What do I care?

890
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,500
You were never a real friend anyway.

891
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,500
But I wonder...

892
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,700
how long could you last as my enemy?

893
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,000
Put the sword down!

894
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,800
Jen!

895
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,500
Everyone out. Shut the doors.

896
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,500
Fine... the friendship is over.

897
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,500
Don't touch it!

898
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:35,700
That's Li Mu Bai's sword.

899
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:39,000
Come and get it if you can.

900
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,700
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.

901
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,300
Don't be a sore loser.

902
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,800
Go ahead. Take your pick.

903
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,500
I'll wait.

904
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,100
Go ahead.

905
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,200
Give me the sword.

906
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,200
Take it!

907
01:30:59,200 --> 01:30:59,800
Stop it!

908
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,300
You don't deserve the Green Destiny.

909
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,900
Not another lecture!

910
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:07,900
On guard!

911
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Let's end this here.

912
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,000
Only the sword will settle this.

913
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:51,900
I only let you go because I wanted to see the real you.

914
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:00,600
What do you know about a true heart?

915
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,500
What do you want?

916
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,200
What I've always wanted, to teach you.

917
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:15,300
All right.

918
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,400
If you can take back the sword in three moves,

919
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,900
I'll go with you.

920
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,200
Give it back!

921
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,200
Kneel! Never!

922
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:29,600
Then you have no use for the sword.

923
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,900
Sooner or later they'd drag you back to Peking.

924
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,900
Your parents will never accept you again.

925
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:52,200
But why go home?

926
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,100
We've gone this far, we won't stop now.

927
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:58,500
You'll always be my Lady.

928
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,900
At last, we'll be our own masters.

929
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:08,100
We'll be happy. That's the most important thing.

930
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,400
All we have left is each other, right?

931
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,000
Lie down and rest.

932
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:42,000
She's crazy. You should have killed her.

933
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:43,900
I didn't have the heart.

934
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:46,900
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

935
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:57,000
Is it me or the sword you want?

936
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:17,900
You've been drugged.

937
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,000
Where is Jade Fox?

938
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,900
What happened?

939
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,600
Jade Fox drugged her.

940
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:24,100
How did you get here?

941
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:28,600
We followed Jade Fox.

942
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:59,700
And so you die.

943
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,800
And so shall you!

944
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:12,600
A poisoned needle!

945
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:18,500
You deserve to die,

946
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,700
but the life I was hoping to take...

947
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:24,200
was Jen's.

948
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:28,000
Ten years I devoted to you.

949
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:29,800
But you deceived me!

950
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,400
You hid the manual's true meaning.

951
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,300
I never improved...

952
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:40,500
but your progress was limitless!

953
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,200
You know what poison is?

954
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:45,700
An eight-year-old girl,

955
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:48,900
full of deceit. That's poison!

956
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:54,000
Jen!

957
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:57,800
My only family...

958
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,900
my only enemy...

959
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,300
You can't die!

960
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,800
Tell us what poison you used!

961
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,000
You can't die!

962
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:17,200
Tell us the antidote!

963
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:20,000
You can't let Li Mu Bai die!

964
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:21,900
She used Purple Yin...

965
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:24,800
Purple Yin poison.

966
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:26,500
It goes straight to the heart.

967
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:32,900
It's the same poison she used to kill my master.

968
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:37,700
My blood will soon reverse its flow.

969
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:40,400
There is no antidote.

970
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:44,600
That can't be! Everything has an antithesis!

971
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,700
Why not this?

972
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,000
The antidote exists.

973
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,600
She taught it to me.

974
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:53,200
The formula is simple,

975
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:55,500
but it takes time to prepare.

976
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,100
Trust me.

977
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:05,200
As you have helped me,

978
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,100
let me help him.

979
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:09,800
All right.

980
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:13,600
Hurry. I will hold on as long as I can.

981
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:16,100
Take my horse and go to the compound.

982
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,900
Give this to Mrs. Wu. She'll help you. Hurry!

983
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:21,900
Spare your energy. I'll be back!

984
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:51,700
Where is Mrs. Wu?

985
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,300
Stop it!

986
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:58,600
Shu Lien told me to show you this.

987
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:00,900
Let her in.

988
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:17,100
Mu Bai, hold on.

989
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,800
Give me some hope.

990
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:47,700
Shu Lien...

991
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,100
Save your strength.

992
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:55,800
My life is departing.

993
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:59,100
I've only one breath left.

994
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,800
Use it to meditate.

995
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:06,800
Free yourself from this world

996
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,300
as you have been taught.

997
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:11,800
Let your soul rise to eternity

998
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,600
with your last breath.

999
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:17,800
Do not waste it...

1000
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,800
for me.

1001
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,500
I've already wasted my whole life.

1002
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,800
I want to tell you with my last breath...

1003
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:32,800
I have always loved you.

1004
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:11,600
I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side...

1005
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:14,300
as a condemned soul...

1006
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:20,700
than enter heaven without you.

1007
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,800
Because of your love...

1008
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:31,200
I will never be a lonely spirit.

1009
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:25,900
He's gone?

1010
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,300
Bo...

1011
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:59,000
please take this sword back to Sir Te.

1012
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:07,700
Now you must go to Wudan Mountain.

1013
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,700
Lo awaits you there.

1014
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:12,800
Promise me one thing.

1015
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:16,000
Whatever path you take in this life...

1016
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,500
be true to yourself.

1017
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:10,900
Do you remember the legend of the young man?

1018
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:15,300
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."

1019
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,300
Make a wish, Lo.

1020
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,600
To be back in the desert, together again.
